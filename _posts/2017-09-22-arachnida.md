With their first release Arachnida, the singer is dealing with the occuring of spiders in her nightly dreams. This is leading her to topics
such as the going down of materialistic being, the borderless continuity between illusion and reality as well as the soul as inhabitant of a dying body. She questions the fact of holding on to used
situations and the mystic of spiders which occur dark on the one hand, but living in a fragile body on the other hand.
