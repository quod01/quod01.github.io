# QUOD
is an electronic musicduo based in Vienna, Austria. The multidisciplinary artists Bianca Anne Braunesberger and Stefan Zotter merge to this artistic expression since 2016.  “life and death, a journey to more consciousness” – strong visions and dreams drive the female voice to go deeper into an artistic output that is meditative, danceable and has a dynamically performative character on stage. This music project is powered by the platform [tauschfühlung](https://tauschfuehlung.at).
